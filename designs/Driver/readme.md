Hello,

I want to highlight a common issue I encountered while traveling on a bus in unfamiliar places. 
There were instances when I couldn't easily reach the conductor to ask about the upcoming stop, and nearby passengers were often unaware as well. To address this, I've come up with a straightforward solution. Imagine if the bus driver could simply click a button indicating the next stop, and a display inside the bus would show the upcoming stop information. This simple feature could greatly enhance passengers' confidence and make their journey more convenient. That's my idea!

The design for the prototype -

Happy to receive suggestions!
